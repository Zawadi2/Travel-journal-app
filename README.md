**INTRO**

Travel Journal app is a web application designed to help users document and reflect on their travel experiences. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can record their thoughts, feelings, and memories from their trips, and relive them anytime. This app is very importnat to me because I love traveling and I believe expeeries are to be lived.  it helps me record and preserve memories of my trips, allowing me to reflect on my experiences and relive them in the future.it inspires me to plan new trips, try new things, and explore different cultures.
